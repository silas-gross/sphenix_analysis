power cycle ALPIDEs
run 65: trigger delay=0x50 clocks, strobe width=20 clocks, same ALPIDE frontend settings as above

requests for OM improvements:

* change the idx diff plots to use chip 3 as a reference, so the plots still make sense when chip 0 has noisy pixels

evening 2018-03-06: INTT is taking 120 GeV protons at ~14k counts on the SC123 scintillators, ~8k triggers/spill
run 66 is empty, run 67 has arbiter=0x3 (only chips 0 and 3)
run 68: same settings as run 65, data looks good
run 69: same settings as above, calibration run
run 70: calibration run, trigger delay=0x50 clocks, strobe width=20 clocks, ITHR=50, IDB=29, VCASN=50, VCASN2=57, IBIAS=64, VCASP=86, VCLIP=0, VRESETD=147 (defaults from git, new-alpide-software ConfigTemplate.cfg)
run 71: same settings, calib run
run 72-75: masked noisy pixels on chip 0
run 76: pulser was left on, junk
run 77: normal run, we notice the beam spot is in the corner row=0 col=1024
run 79: moved box down ~1cm to bring beam closer to the center of the chip. Beam now centered off right edge of chip ~(474,268)
run 82: good run with large statistics

2018-03-07
during the day, the telescope was moved from the 80-20 stand to a platform
beam: 120 GeV protons, 10k triggers/spill
run 83:empty run, did not get beam
1702: replaced chip ID 0 with the new ALPIDE bonded by SiDet
run 84, 85: calib with new chip, chip does not seem to work
run 86: revert to old chip 0, works
run 87: waiting for beam
run 88: we see a beamspot
run 89: Placed single lead brick in front of the box oriented with its face normal to the beam axis. 2 in thick or ~0.3 interaction lengths
Added three more bricks: 8 in, 1.2 interaction lengths
swapped in the SiDet ALPIDE again
run 90: calib, pulser, still looks bad (chip ID 2 is unplugged)
swapped back
run 91: beam with four bricks: primary beam is reduced, background is increased, looks like the high-multiplicity events are being attenuated (runtype mistakenly left as calib for runs 91 and 92)
run 95: two bricks in the beam
run 96: at INTT request, MCR is tuning the beam to shrink the size
run 97: tuning is done?
run 98: bricks out, adjusted box 1/4" down and right, beamspot is centered (very short run)
run 99: clustering enabled, weird checkerboard patterns (this was a problem with a decoder, now fixed) (DID NOT UPDATE ALPIDEPARAMETERS.DAT FOR THIS RUN, SHOULD SAY cluster = on)
run 100: clustering disabled (DID NOT UPDATE ALPIDEPARAMETERS.DAT FOR THIS RUN, SHOULD SAY cluster = off)
run 101: testing continuous mode, doesn't work
run 102: back to normal settings

120 GeV p+, about 15k triggers per spill
run 103: calib run, baseline with same sensors as yesterday, we are now on the rotary table which reads 1.5 degrees on its GUI
run 104: masked additional pixel on chip ID 0
run 106: switch chip ID 0 to the sensor bonded at SiDet today (serial 15_03A), it works (couple of noisy pixels)
run 107, 108: switch chip ID 0 to the sensor bonded at SiDet yesterday (serial 15_04A), and mask the bad pixel (column 133, row 208), now it works
run 110: switched back to the original chip ID 0
run 113: beam is here, it is centered vertically but about 1/8" left of us
run 114: moved the box left 1/8", beam is centered
run 115: rotate table to 6.0 degrees
run 116: rotate table to 12.0 degrees, looks great
run 117: table back to 1.5 degrees, INTT requested to remove the collimator so beam is changing during this run
run 118: beam spot is now shifted to the right by about 1/4"
run 119: moved the box right to get new baseline
run 120: Beam profile reduced as requested by INTT
run 121: rotate table to -18 degrees. looks like no correlation between chip 1+2+3. ~100k events
run 122: quick junk run to check OM changes
run 123: rotate table to -16 degrees. Still no correlation between chips 1/2/3.
run 124: rotate table to -15 degrees. Chips 1 and 3 are correlated. >1.75M events
run 125: rotate table back to 1.5 deg. INTT placed 2 lead bricks in front of their box.


beam is -10 GeV "low energy pion"
run 126: beamparameters.dat is not updated
run 127: restart the run to pull in the correct beamparameters.dat
run 128: mask four noisy pixels seen in the previous run (206,471 211,472 206,474 205,474). ~2M triggers. Good candidate for alignment studies.
run 129: more of the same
run 130: -3V bias is connected to chip ID 3 (power supply current ~0.5 mA), no hits on chip 3
runs 130-134 are runtype junk (rcdaq crashed and the runtype was not set)
run 131: restart run to pull in updated alpideparameters.dat, still no hits on chip 3
run 132: changed ALPIDE parameters for chip 3 to VCASN=105 VCLIP=60 VCASN2=117, now we see hits on chip 3
run 133: restart run to pull in updated alpideparameters.dat
run 134: restart run, alpideparameters.dat had a typo in the previous run (VCASN2_ID3 twice instead of VCASN_ID3 and VCASN2_ID3), 3M events
