These are some example files I used to extract the data from the histograms. 
They are not documented as they were never inteded to be used by others, but
I am provided them as _inspiring_ code for your anaalysis needs. I almost guarentee 
that the code will not run out of the box.
I think photonEff and conversionRate will be the most museful.
