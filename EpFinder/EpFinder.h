 * \description:
 * Finds the Event Plane (EP) and EP-related quantities.
 * Also creates correction files and applies them.
 * Also calculates resolution
 *
 * There is a lot of EP-related information.  Raw, phi-weighted, shifted, etc.
 * 1st, 2nd, nth order.  Q-vector and Psi.  Even if the user does not request
 * all of these things, it is convenient and not so wasteful to simply calculate
 * them all at once.  Therefore, the user is presented with a large object of
 * type StEpdEpInfo.  This avoids "calculate-it-on-the-fly" which can be wasteful
 * if the user requests more than one thing, as well as "has-it-already-been-calculated?"
 * ambiguities.
 *
 *   A word about "EventType": the correction factors and other things about the event
 * plane can depend on centrality, vertex position, etc.  This code will apply the
 * corrections separately for different "EventTypes".  It is up to the user to decide
 * what this denotes.  All I care about is that when you send me an event, you tell
 * me the EventTypeId, which is just an integer.  The rest is up to you (as it should be :).
 *   For many (most?) people, this will just be a centrality index.
 *
 * This class will do "phi-weighting" and "shifting" corrections, but it needs
 *  some information to do it.  It will generate such information itself, but
 *  here is what you need to do, if you are starting from scratch:
 * 1) With whatever multiplicity/Vz/whatever event cuts you are going to analyze, and
 *    on whatever dataset, run your code that calls this class.  This will produce
 *    a file called EpFinderCorrectionHistograms_OUTPUT.root in the cwd.
 *    --> mv EpFinderCorrectionHistograms_OUTPUT.root EpFinderCorrectionHistos_INPUT.root
 *    That takes care of the Phi-weighting
 * 2) Repeat the above step (including the rename of the file, overwriting the old one).
 *      That takes care of the shifting weights.
 * 3) You are good to go.
 *
 *
 * ------------------------------------------
 * This class creates some histograms and uses some histograms.  Since I use GetBinContent()
 *  to extract values from the histograms, the binning is important.  I try to keep things
 *  consistent, but let me explain.
 *
 * 1) Phi Weighting.  Used by EpFinder and created by EpFinder.
 *    This code creates a histogram with the root name 
 *    "PhiWeight"
 *    x-axis and y-axis are USER DEFINED IN THE EpFinder constructor. 
 *    The user has no direct interaction with this histogram.
 *
 * 2) Shifting correction.  Used by EpFinder and created by EpFinder.
 *    This implements equation (6) of arxiv:nucl-ex/9805001
 *    The histogram names are
 *     - Form("EpdShiftdPsi%d_sin",ew,order)   
 *     - Form("EpdShiftdPsi%d_cos",ew,order)   
 *     - Form("EpdShiftFullEventPsi%d_sin",order)
 *     - Form("EpdShiftFullEventPsi%d_cos",order)
 *    In these histograms, order is "n" (as in n=2 for second-order EP)
 *    x-axis is "i" from equation (6) above.  As in <cos(n*i*Psi_n)>
 *       There are _EpTermsMax bins running from 0.5 to _EPtermsMax+0.5, so there should be no confusion with this axis.
 *    y-axis is EventTypeId, the *user-defined* EventType bin number.
 *--------->>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> And at this point I must make a demand of the user <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
 *    When the user instantiates an EpFinder object, he specifies nEventTypeBins, the number of EventType bins he will use.
 *       >>>> The user MUST number these bins 0,1,2,3,4,...(nEventTypeBins-1) when he interacts with this class <<<<
 *       (If he wants to use a different convention in his code, that's fine, but when talking to EpFinder, use 0..(nEventTypeBins-1)
 *    The y-axis then has nEventTypeBins bins, going from -0.5 to nEventTypeBins-0.5
